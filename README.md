# Introduction
This is a simple repository of implementing Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
in Scala. Currently, the examples and implementation here are adapted 
heavily from the [Monte Carlo Tree Search Research Hub](http://mcts.ai).

# What's New

## The Game of Hex
The Game of Hex has been added as a new game demonstrating how MCTS works in a two-player game.
